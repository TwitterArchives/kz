Yesterday.   dont like the “wow imagine if the roles were reversed” thing but when Trump had “mild symptoms” of Covid a little over a year ago the media questioned him on everything.

I know you said in your previous tweet not to view interviewing Nick as an endorsement but I’d love to see you on cozy tv someday.

This was also the democrat position pre 2008. It’s worth talking about. The sneers of being called anti gay don’t bother social conservatives.

We disagree on the whole “legality” thing, I think there’s evidence to suggest that aside from the moral issue , the NIH and CDC estimate those lifestyles take up to 30 years off lifespans. But I appreciate your honesty in answering and your work <!--1549538739776618498-->

The majority of Republicans and the majority of Democrats were against gay marriage.   Now republicans are voting in lock step with democrats in defense of gay marriage. The @GOP needs to be destroyed and rebuilt by America First patriots <!--1549531432468480000-->
