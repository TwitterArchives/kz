There is no excuse for Disney, a billion dollar company, to be fucking up this much https://twitter.com/maclunkey18/status/1531351071985004544 <!--1531850341804826624-->

Revenge of the Sith, which is over 15 years old was made for about $50 million less, and it’s looks, sounds and feels better.   It’s inexcusable. It’s terrible filmmaking. https://twitter.com/vara_dark/status/1530397719893794818 <!--1531850067220566016-->

Could it be because he’s a good actor and was well written? pic.twitter.com/Q404NXV3af <!--1531849045186121728-->

Most Star Wars fans have been saying for years that John Boyega’s character should’ve been the lead in the sequel trilogy and that it was a crime what they did to his character. It’s a bad show. https://twitter.com/starwars/status/1531804726165401600 <!--1531847574772240384-->
